yakbot
======

This is Son of Yakbot, or yakbot v2. Unlike his predecessor (who was built on [supybot](http://sourceforge.net/projects/supybot/)), son of yakbot is written using Twisted. He is intended to perform certain specific actions, so the bells and whistles of a generic bot are left out. He's got plug-ins for development convenience and organization, but beyond that, he's barren.

The original yakbot is in a private github repo, because I kept his data and conf in it. 99% of the core was supybot, so I didn't think anyone needed it. His plug-ins, however, are still available in [Yakbot-plugins](https://github.com/theY4Kman/Yakbot-plugins).

Feel free to submit issues or merge requests. I would love that, and so would son of yakbot. He just smiled and nodded at me, so you know I'm not lying.
